Your Story/Bio (Extended)
My journey started in digital communication, working with public institutions 
and leaders across Morocco. I quickly realized that great communication 
strategy without the right technology is incomplete.


That's why I pursued advanced studies in Embedded AI while building my 
consultancy practice - to bridge the gap between strategic communication 
and technical innovation.


Today, I work with:
- Public figures and elected officials on strategic positioning and digital influence
- Institutions and local governments on communication excellence and digital transformation
- Civic organizations on Smart Cities solutions and public service modernization


My mission: To advance Morocco's institutional digital capabilities through 
practical solutions, strategic excellence, and technological innovation.


Currently developing Smart Cities platforms that apply AI to improve 
citizen-government interactions, while continuing to advise public sector 
leaders on strategic communication and digital transformation.
